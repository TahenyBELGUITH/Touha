   review: "We meet many people every day but only some leave a mark. One of them is Taheny. She was my partner at Microverse for a block during the second module. I was more than impressed by Tahenyâ€™s technical ability to craft efficient solutions to the problems we faced. This natural skill helped me grow as a developer since she facilitated the growth of my ability to think outside the box. I surely did enjoy my time working with Taheny and look forward to collaborating again. Taheny will be a valuable asset to any company."
